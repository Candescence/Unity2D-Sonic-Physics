# Unity2D-Sonic-Physics
An attempt at implementing classic Sonic the Hedgehog-style physics using Unity's 2D components, based on the Sonic Physics Guide - http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Physics_Guide

Uses Unity 2021.1, and Unity's new input module.

IS CURRENTLY VERY SERIOUSLY BROKEN. Do not expect to use it seriously unless the problems with the implementation are fixed.
